                        using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from
                        the bill payer for using the app.</p>

                                Currently all vouchers are free to buy / redeem for the users

                                It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the voucher code in each voucher is entered by the outlet in the foodeebuddee system provided to the eatery / outlet. On successful entry by the eatery / outlet in the vendor system, the user will get an instant SMS plus an email from foodeebuddee informing the same

                                The user can of course, improve their credit score, by ensuring they use the redeemed vouchers on every occasion, thus aiding the foodeebuddee algorithm to increase the visibility of vouchers for them In the event the user, takes a voucher and places it in the CART, but has not redeemed it in full, the voucher does not still belong to the user, as the vouchers will be limited in nature and open to other users from redeeming it.  Foodeebuddee does not remind the user about the diminishing number of vouchers available

                            <li>
                                Foodeebuddee takes NO responsibility for bad internet connection or mobile data, due to which the process of checking out ended abruptly Foodeebuddee takes no responsibility for any Internet data used for the redeeming or working on foodeebuddee
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the voucher were successfully redeemed within the foodeebuddee system (but yet to be used in the Eatery), an email plus a notification and automated posts on the Users Social feed within foodeebuddee would indicate the success

                                The users can share the voucher on other platforms with their friends and family. They can also share the event that they successfully redeemed a coupon other social platforms. These events of sharing happen from within foodeebuddee to other platforms
